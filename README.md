# Alfred
Alfred - Workplaces are more fun when you can break (company-sponsored) bread with your co-workers on zoom while discussing things you love!

How does this work, you ask? Allow us to describe the features that makes hosting such sessions seamless and fun.
1. Easily create a remote lunch session: Just type "/familymeal" in your channel and Alfred is at your service to help you create a session!
2. Conversations are more fun when people share common interests: Admin chooses topics of discussion for each meeting room.
3. Sit back while we set up the invites: We post an interactive poll for your coworkers to participate in. Everybody gets to choose which room they want to participate in.
4. Wait for your gift card: Prior to the meeting, we send all the participants an uberEats gift card. Indulge in gluttony, or eat a salad, we leave it upto you!
5. Join the meeting rooms: Alfred is a bit clingy, he knows where you are and what you like. He wants to share with y'all some interesting stuff he read online. Have fun with your meal!
